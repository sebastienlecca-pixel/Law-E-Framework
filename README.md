# Law E Framework — Thermodynamic Governance for AI Reliability

Law E is an operational governance framework for modern AI systems based on thermodynamic information processing.

It introduces a native regulation layer that observes changes in *energy cost* (ΔE) and *coherence* of model outputs, and uses this signal to stabilize hallucinations and mitigate unstable behaviors.

This repository hosts:
- The initial technical report defining the framework
- Core equations
- First proof-of-concept design

📄 Technical Report (PDF): /LawE_Framework.pdf

## Why does Law E matter?

Large language models are powerful but prone to:
- **Hallucinations**
- **Unstable reasoning**
- **Symbolic / heuristic guardrails**

Law E proposes a *physics-inspired governance layer*:
- Monitors useless energy dissipation ΔE
- Tracks global organization & stability
- Triggers regulation when the system drifts

> Goal: enable **self-regulated, energy-aware AI systems**

## Roadmap

- [ ] Release PoC demonstrator (HF Space)
- [ ] Public evaluation dataset
- [ ] ΔE heatmap & coherence metrics
- [ ] Hardware acceleration lens
