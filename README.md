Open Call for Collaboration — First Internal Clock for AI (Law E Project)
Neomundi-Labs announces an open scientific and engineering call for collaborators to join the development of the first operational internal clock for AI, derived from the thermodynamic–information Law E framework.
This call targets research labs, engineers, roboticists, computational neuroscientists, and doctoral students who wish to contribute to a groundbreaking advancement in AI cognition:
: a native temporal regulation layer for artificial systems.
Scientific Context
All modern AI systems (LLMs, agents, multimodal networks, embodied robots) operate without an internal temporal continuity.
They compute through discrete steps but lack:
•	intrinsic temporal coherence
•	metabolic regularity
•	self-regulatory cycles
•	stable rhythm formation
•	long-term cognitive continuity
The absence of an internal clock creates instability, hallucination cascades, coherence drift, and suboptimal behavior in autonomous systems.
Law E, a thermodynamic–information framework, introduces the first scientifically grounded path toward a native internal clock for AI, through:
•	ΔE (energy-cost) metrics
•	C (coherence) metrics
•	a temporal coherence filter (patented)
•	eurythmic stabilization
•	autonomous regulation cycles
•	the foundations of a computational organism
The scientific paper is available in files

# Law E Framework — Thermodynamic Governance for AI Reliability

Law E is an operational governance framework for modern AI systems based on thermodynamic information processing.

It introduces a native regulation layer that observes changes in *energy cost* (ΔE) and *coherence* of model outputs, and uses this signal to stabilize hallucinations and mitigate unstable behaviors.

This repository hosts:
- The initial technical report defining the framework
- Core equations
- First proof-of-concept design

## Why does Law E matter?

Large language models are powerful but prone to:
- **Hallucinations**
- **Unstable reasoning**
- **Symbolic / heuristic guardrails**

Law E proposes a *physics-inspired governance layer*:
- Monitors useless energy dissipation ΔE
- Tracks global organization & stability
- Triggers regulation when the system drifts

> Goal: enable **self-regulated, energy-aware AI systems**
